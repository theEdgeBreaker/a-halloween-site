                <p>Halloween is a celebration on the night of October 31st. It is most practised in the United States and Canada. 
                  Children wear costumes and go topeople's homes saying "Trick or treat!" to ask for candy (sweets in the UK) and 
                  people give it to them. The suggestion is: "Give me a treat or  I will play a trick on you." People traditionally 
                  dress up as ghosts, witches, or other scary things for Halloween. It is often referred to as ‘the scariest time of the year’.

                  For Christians it is the eve of All Saints' Day, which begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide. 
                  This covers the three days – October 31 (All-Hallows Eve or Hallowe'en), November 1 (All Saints) and November 2 (All Souls). 
                  All Hallows' is a Christianized holiday and originated in Ireland. It also has pagan roots.

                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>Halloween originated from Ireland. The pagan holiday Samhain, which the All Saints holy day replaced, 
                  was also known as the Day of the Dead. Many wiccans and modern pagans celebrate the Day of the Dead. 
                  It is the day that some believed the souls of dead people come back to Earth.This is a happy holiday 
                  (even though it celebrates death) because some of the souls will visit the homes of their family. 
                  Pope Gregory III originally designated Halloween on November 1 as a time to honor all saints. 
                  Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain.

                  Many Lutheran churches celebrate a holiday on November 2 called the Reformation. 
                  This holiday celebrates the day that Martin Luther put The Ninety-Five Theses on a church door.
                  
                  After mass Irish and Scottish immigration in the 19th century, Halloween became a major holiday in America.

                  <h3>Symbols</h3>
                  <p>Development of symbols connected with Halloween formed over time. Jack-o'-lanterns are traditionally carried on All Hallows' 
                  Eve in order to scare evil spirits. Elements of the fall season, such as pumpkins, harvest, and scarecrows, are also common. 
                  Homes are often decorated with these types of symbols around Halloween. Halloween imagery includes themes of horror, magic and the supernatural. 
                  Black, and orange are Halloween's traditional colors.

                  <h3>Costumes</h3>
                  <p>During Halloween some people, especially children, wear a costume. People have worn costumes at Halloween for centuries. 
                  Wearing a costume may come from Celtic festivals of Samhain and Calan Gaeaf. It could also be from the Christian Allhallowtide.

                  Early costumes were usually scary. They were often supernatural beings or from folklore. In the 1930s costumes of characters 
                  from literature, radio, or movies became popular, and such costumes are also popular today. Scary costumes are still popular.
